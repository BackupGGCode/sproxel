# Feature Requests : Round 1 #
  * ~~Clickable palette (not a separate popup)~~

  * Camera-snapping (like maya's camera cube).

  * ~~Face-hoover for ray intersection or a ghost voxel for next intersection.~~

  * Photoshop-style voxel grid resizing.  Make a full dialog!

  * Palette sampling from a loaded image.

  * 3d selection -- all, slice, click 2 corners, etc

  * Cut/Copy/Paste

  * Tetris-style block dropping

  * Infinitely-expanding bounding box

  * Image planes in all 3 axes of model view as reference.

  * Sprite animation timeline

  * Proper geometric construction (no overlap)

  * Hide cursor (the one that pops up when arrow keys are pressed)

  * Cool "Voxatron"-style floor plane

  * Brushes

  * Configurable keys & mouse shortcuts.

  * Ortho projection widget (from all 6 directions)

  * OBJ export option for individual cubes in addition to seamless mesh.

  * ~~Python plug-ins:~~
    * ~~Custom exporters~~
    * ~~Custom importers~~
    * ~~Custom UI~~ - via PySide, needs more testing
    * Custom tools
    * Rendering custom objects in Sproxel viewports

  * ~~Dialog to change a bunch of UI settings.  Like...~~
    * Fixed lighting direction
    * ~~Voxels with smoothed normals~~
    * ~~Axis of operation~~
    * ~~GL window background color~~
    * ~~Grid/cell sizes~~

  * ~~Draw bounding box~~  - Correctly draw bounding box lines

  * ~~"Up/Down" a subdivision (resolution) level~~  - Could use better UI/accessibility

  * ~~Polygon model export (OBJ, etc)~~  - ~~Cull internal polygons!~~

  * ~~Rotation around major axes.~~

  * ~~Flip / Flop / Floop (mirroring around each axis)~~

  * ~~Command-line loading~~

  * ~~2d image import~~

  * ~~Dirty bit (save on exit, etc)~~

  * ~~Click to fill in an X,Y,or Z slice.~~ - ~~Could use a XYZ slice display.~~

  * ~~Shift everything up, down, left, right (with and w/o wrap)~~

  * ~~Hide 2d grid~~

  * ~~Undo/redo  -  Finish up the command merging.~~

  * ~~"fg/bg" color, press a key to toggle between them (photoshop keys)~~

  * ~~2d flood-fill in x,y, or z~~


# Feature Requests : Artists' Perspective #
  * Additional options for the Flood tool: only operating within an active slice, in 3D (contiguous) and scene-wide (non-contiguous).

  * Pasting of pixel graphics (Edit > Paste from 2D file).

  * ~~Slices, including options to hide everything behind the active slice, in front of the active slice or to hide both sides.  Easy to switch in and out of the mode as well.~~

  * Selection tool.  (3 click process)

  * Move, rotate, and scale (on selections)

  * Copy, cut and paste (on selections)

  * Extrusion tool for selections.

  * Click+drag tool operation.

  * ~~Line~~ & rectangle

  * Multiple voxel grids (animation and/or layers)

  * ~~Indexed color mode voxel grids~~

  * ~~New project file that contains palettes, multiple grids, and per-voxel meta.~~

  * Palette objects + saving/loading/customizing, etc.

  * ~~Paint3D import/export (3MP).  Documented here: http://www.paint3d.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=46~~

  * Visual handles for many tools.  Mirror, rotate, move, etc.

  * ~~A "builder brush" or a moving grid you can modify things in.~~ Slicing does it.
