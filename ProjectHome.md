Sproxel is a 3d interface designed to let the user quickly create and edit voxel-based 3d models.  The creation process and resulting geometry can be thought of as an extension to 2d pixel art.

Sproxel is in its infancy, but can already generate sprites for custom game engines.

Check out the user manual on the Wiki and try your hand at making your own voxel model.  Feature requests are encouraged!
